Implementing synchronization using this ability based on pthreads mutex variables would likely be difficult because since each mutex variable will be guarding nodes on the linked list, when insert and delete operations are called, the size of the list changes and with the size changing, the one would need to make sure that the nodes corresponding to each guard variables do not collide and this involves more computation. FOr example, when subsequent insert or delete operation is done, various nodes of the list is added or removed hence various guard variables are created and destroyed dynamically and when the nature of the program is not known, it will be almost difficult to implement. In addition to, more than one mutex lock variable would need to be potentially accessed when doing multiple insert or delete if the nodes guarded by those variables are few.
