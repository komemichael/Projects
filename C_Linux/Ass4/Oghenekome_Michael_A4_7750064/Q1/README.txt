To compile use: gcc -o listTest list.c mymem.c

To run use: ./listTest



I rewrote the list.c file to test the almagamation if it works.

It does not use the listnode structure but the freeListNodePtr.

Test cases are in list.c

Follow compiler use and use run statement as indicated above.
