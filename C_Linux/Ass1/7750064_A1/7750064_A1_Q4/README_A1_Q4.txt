The set command should be of the form "set $VAR =variabledelimeter"

For example "set $KOME =-l"

When you do this there will be no output but when you use it you use it as $KOME
For example "ls -a $KOME" 

It will then run as "ls -a -l" and return each result

How ever the setting has to be done before. The variables can be reused over and over again.
