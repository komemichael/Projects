# 
# Purpose:     The purpose of the python program is to compute and display
#              the trajectory of a projectile given the initial launch angle,
#              the initial velocity, the initial height and the number of time
#              intervals.The launch angle is specified in degrees. The initial
#              velocity is in meters per seconds and the initial height is in 
#	       metres.The number of time intervals is used to compute the number 
#              of time values for which the X and Y coordinates are to be computed
#              for the trajectory.The output from the program is a table of time
#              values and the corresponding X and Y coordinates of the projectile.
