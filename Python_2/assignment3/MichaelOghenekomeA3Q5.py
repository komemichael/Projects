# Purpose:   The purpose of this question is to run the three previous programs 
#            that are the solution to question 2,3 and 4 of assignment 3 with 
#            a=15 and b=6 for ten million intervals and answer the questions 
#            from question 5

Solutions

(a)  The time Python took to run the circumference of the ellipse for question 

       2 is 22.364 seconds


(b)  The time Python took to run the circumference of the ellipse for question 

       3 is 67.679 seconds


(c)  The time Python took to run the circumference of the ellipse for question 

       4 is 0.631seconds


(d) The program that ran the slowest was question 3
 
     (using arrays without vector arithmetics)


(e) The program that ran the fastest was question 4

     (using arrays without vector arithmetics)


(f) I concluded that using arrays without vector arithmetic is not a good
 
     python programming practice, It is better to use list if vector arithmetic

     is not to be used and best to use arrays if vector arithmetics could be used
